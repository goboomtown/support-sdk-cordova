/**
 *  @brief `TVINetworkQualityLevel` represents the Network Quality Level.
 *
 *  @discussion Twilio's Video SDKs, where possible, attempt to calculate a singular Network Quality Level describing
 *  the quality of a Participant's connection to a Room. This value ranges from -1 to 5, with -1 representing that the
 *  Network Quality Level can not be determined, 0 representing a failed network connection, 1 representing a poor
 *  network connection, and 5 representing an excellent network connection. The SDK calculates this metric only when
 *  connected to Group Rooms. In case of a connection to Peer-to-Peer Room the value is expected to be -1 at all times.
 *
 *  Note that the Network Quality Level is not an absolute metric but a score relative to the demand being placed on
 *  the network. For example, the NQ score might be a 5 while on a good network and publishing only an AudioTrack.
 *  Later, if a HD VideoTrack is added, the score might come down to 2. This also means that when the network is not
 *  being used at all (i.e. the Client is neither publishing nor subscribing to any tracks) the Network Quality Level
 *  will always be 5 given that any network will be capable of complying with a zero communications demand.
