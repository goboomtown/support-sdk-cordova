# Boomtown Product Support Platform SDK for ios

### Getting Started 

After cloning the project you will need to retrieve dependencies. This is done with Carthage (https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Once you have installed Carthage you should run the following command:

```
carthage update --platform iOS
```

Go get a coffee. It will take a while.

Once you have done that you can build the SDK or the Test app by selecting the appropriate build scheme.
